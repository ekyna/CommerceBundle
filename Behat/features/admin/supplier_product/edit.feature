    Scenario: Edit the supplier product
        When I go to "ekyna_commerce_supplier_product_admin_edit" route with "supplierId:1,supplierProductId:1"
        And I fill in "supplier_product[designation]" with "Samsung Galaxy Tab B"
        And I fill in "supplier_product[reference]" with "S-GTAB-B"
        And I press "supplier_product_actions_save"
        Then I should see the resource saved confirmation message
        And I should see "TechData"
        #And I show the "supplier-catalog" tab
        And I should see "Samsung Galaxy Tab B"
        And I should see "S-GTAB-B"
